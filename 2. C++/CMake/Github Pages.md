**Github Pages** can be used for upload HTML documentation generated by [[Doxygen]] to a web server.

1. For enable Github Pages, go on Github website, in parameters of project. In _Pages_, select branch which can used for generating documenation, and save. The best is to create a `gh-pages` branch specific for documenation.
2. Create a `.github` folder at root of project, and a `documentation.yaml`, who can be found at this  [link](https://github.com/franneck94/UdemyCmake/blob/master/2_CMake/12_Final/.github/workflows/documentation.yaml). It run build of documenation on Ubuntu virtual machine, and deploy our documentation on Github Pages.
3. Push code and new file on Github, Pages will appear shortly after.
