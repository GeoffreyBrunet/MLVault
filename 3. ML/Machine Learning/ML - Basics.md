# Introduction
There are three Machine learning techniques:
-   Supervised learning
-   Unsupervised learning
-   Reinforcement learning

# Supervised learning

In **supervised learning**, the machine receives data characterized by $x$ variables and annotated with a $y$ variable. $x$ is called a feature, and $y$ a label (or few times, called target).

If $y$ is discrete or qualitative, we gonna use classification model, and if $y$ is continuous, we gonna use regression model.

Steps for use supervised learning in machine learning project:
-   Define a dataset
-   Choose the type of model of machine learning
-   Define hyperparameters
-   Training phase

# Unsupervised learning
**Unsupervised learning** is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, which is an important mode of learning in people, the machine is forced to build a concise representation of its world and then generate imaginative content from it.

# Reinforcement learning
**Reinforcement learning** is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.
