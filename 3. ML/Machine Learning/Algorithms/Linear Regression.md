# About
The **linear regression** allows us to make prediction of a data $Y$ with respect to another independent data $X$, which gives $Y=g(X)$, where $g$ is the function we have to find. The input data is a **table with two columns** $X$ and $Y$. Finding the right function $G$ is called a **regression**, and the best way to do this is to assume that $G$ is a linear function. The function of a linear regression is:

$$
g(x)=\alpha x+\beta
$$

where $\alpha$ is the slope and $\beta$ is the intercept of this line. To do a linear regression, just choose $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that make this line fit the data best.
